# TicTacToe
This is a python game of TicTacToe made using the pygame library. It's a simple project but it's my first one, so I'm looking forward to do more things like this.
Although my interests are not in game development or anything like that, it's fun to keep it as a hobby.
As for this program, it's coded to say when any player wins or if it ends in a draw. I haven't found any bugs yet (I don't think it's possible, the code is short) but if you found any I will be happy to check them. 
Finally I didn't know how to make the square a cross, it's not readily available in pygame. So if you know how, please message me or edit the code c: 
Thanks for reading
